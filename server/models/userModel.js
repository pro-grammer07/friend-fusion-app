// documentation for userModel.js 
// This file is used to create a schema for the user model.
// The schema is used to define the structure of the data that will be stored in the database.
// The schema is then used to create a model which is used to interact with the database.
// The model is used to perform CRUD operations on the database.
// The schema defines the fields that will be stored in the database and the type of data that will be stored in each field.
// The model is used to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.
// The schema is created using the mongoose library which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
